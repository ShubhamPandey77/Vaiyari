          We are a travel community built for people who love exploring the mountains, meeting new people, and creating stories that last a lifetime. Every Friday, we organize curated trips across the North India circuit — from peaceful hill stations to adventurous getaways. Over the years, more than 5,000+ travellers have trusted us to plan their journeys, and that trust is what drives us every day.

The company was started by two founders with complementary strengths. Aarav brings strong experience in distribution, operations, and scaling communities, ensuring every trip runs smoothly from booking to return. Tushar comes from a deep travel-industry background and has hands-on experience managing routes, stays, and on-ground logistics across North India. Together, we focus on making travel simple, safe, and memorable.

Our goal is not just to run tours, but to build a reliable travel ecosystem where everything is planned, transparent, and comfortable. While North India remains our core focus today, we are actively working towards expanding into more circuits across India and internationally. Wherever we go, our promise stays the same — honest pricing, smooth execution, and unforgettable experiences.
